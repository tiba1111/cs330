 How do I approach designing software?
Begin by:
Understanding Requirements: Gather input from stakeholders, define user needs, and identify constraints.
Planning: Develop a roadmap, break down the project into smaller components, and decide on tools and technologies.
Prototyping: Build wireframes or mockups to visualize the solution early.
Feedback Loop: Gather feedback iteratively to refine designs.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Improved problem-solving techniques, particularly in visualizing abstract concepts.
Enhanced user-centric thinking, focusing on usability and user experience.
Better understanding of scalability and modular design.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
Ideation and Research: Brainstorming potential solutions and researching existing technologies.
Wireframing and Prototyping: Visualizing ideas through sketches or digital prototypes.
Implementation: Transforming designs into functional components.
Testing and Iteration: Incorporating user feedback and improving functionality.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Iterative design can be applied to minimize risks in complex projects.
Modularization ensures reusability in future systems.
User-centric approaches ensure alignment with real-world needs.
Developing Programs
How do I approach developing programs?
Define the Problem: Clearly articulate the goals and constraints.
Plan: Break down tasks into manageable modules.
Develop: Write clean, maintainable, and modular code.
Test: Continuously test during development to catch issues early.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Spatial Thinking: Managing object positioning, scaling, and transformations.
Optimization: Reducing rendering time through efficient data structures.
Use of Libraries: Leveraging tools like OpenGL, Three.js, or Unity for 3D development.
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration allowed for continuous improvement, with each cycle addressing:
Visual details (lighting, texture).
Functionality (interactions, animations).
Performance (frame rates, memory usage).
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Adopted agile principles, focusing on incremental delivery.
Improved ability to manage dependencies and integrate them seamlessly.
Gained experience in debugging complex systems.
